#Day20 of My LeetCode Journey â€“ Problem 387: First Unique Character in a String
This one was all about character frequency and smart indexing.

ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary:
ðŸ§¾ Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character and return its index.
 If none exist, return -1.

ðŸ’¡ My Approach:
Used a dictionary to store character frequencies. Then, looped through the string again to find the first character with frequency 1.

ðŸ§ª Example:
Input: "leetcode"
 Output: 0 (â†’ 'l' is the first non-repeating character)
Input: "loveleetcode"
 Output: 2 (â†’ 'v' is the first unique one)

ðŸ§  What I Learned:
Use dictionaries to count frequencies efficiently
Lookups in dictionaries are fast and great for string-related problems
Always check edge cases like: "", "aabb", or long strings
Another small win on this learning path ðŸš€
 On to the next problem tomorrow!
